# NumberGame :
This is a number game made by me. You have to guess the number on the basis of certain hints. Example: Random number(selected by the computer) = 5478 and you entered the number = 5489 then the hint shown will be right number = 3 (three numbers are common not necessarily in the same order) and right position = 2 (two number are common and are in the same order).


# NumberGame2 : 
In this program you have to guess the correct number on the basis of hints like the number which you have entered is above or below the random number.
