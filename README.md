This is a number game made by me. You have to guess the number on the basis of certain hints. Example: Random number(selected by the computer) = 5478 and you entered the number = 5489 then the hint shown will be right number = 3 (three numbers are common not necessarily in the same order) and right position = 2 (two number are common and are in the same order).

In this program you have to guess the correct number on the basis of hints like the number which you have entered is above or below the random number.
